                <h1>WOW Awards for the Best Online Casinos?</h1>
                <p>The online gambling industry is one of the world's largest and most exciting sectors. Not only does it represent some of the most outstanding achievements in the early adoption of new technologies and the implementation of existing tech, but it demands a level of excellence and creativity not found in many other markets. <br />

We place a premium on online casinos that treat players fairly, offer value for money, and work to promote a positive online gambling experience. The other side of the coin is the growing number of casino sites players should avoid due to predatory or unfair terms and practices. <br />

To help our community share their positive experiences and shine a light on the casinos striving for excellence, CasinoWow hosts an annual players' choice award called the WOW Awards. <br /></p>

                <h1>What are the WOW Awards?</h1>
                <p>The WOW Awards are an annual player-driven award ceremony where you vote on the best and brightest online casinos, games, and providers of the past year. <br />

The team at CasinoWow compile several lists of nominees based purely on their performance and player feedback over the year. It is impossible for a casino operator to buy or negotiate their way into the awards as the ratings of the sites are publicly available on the CasinoWow website.</p>

                <h1>How do the WOW Awards work?</h1>
                <p>What makes the WOW Awards unique and exciting is the interplay between the players and the brands that have been nominated.

Once the nominees are announced, they are posted on a special webpage dedicated to collating the votes for each category. Users must log in with their registered email address to place their votes. This process ensures fair play and accurate results. <br />

The nominated parties are notified of their nominations and then have approximately a month to campaign for your vote. We allow these casinos and streamers to share their nomination, as well as which category they're in the running for, with their customers and online communities via email and all social media channels. <br />

After the fun and excitement of the month-long build-up, we allow 48 hours for voters to make their voices heard at the polls. We take the next 72 hours to ensure that there are no bots or duplicate votes and announce the winners via email, social media, and an update to the Winners section of the WOW Awards landing page.</p>

                <h1>Random Results</h1>
                <p>The clearest example of such a game is casino slot games. The player has absolutely no bearing on the result of the game. They just spin the reels and hold their thumbs in hopes of a favourable outcome. All outcomes are completely random and are controlled by a sophisticated random number generator that holds very little bias. No casino, provider, or player can tell when the next win will be made.

The house edge is far more favourable to the casino in this instance, which means you have less chance of making wins here than in table games. However, the jackpots and high wins are generally far more lucrative, not to mention the atmosphere of the game being far more attractive.</p>

                <p>We do not take the safety and security of the information you share with us lightly. We use the same levels of encryption on the WOW Awards pages as on the rest of CasinoWow to protect your right to privacy. <br />

This focus on security means you can trust that your personal information and voting preferences for the best online casinos will remain private and not be shared with any third parties in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (EU GDPR).</p>

                <h1>Best Online Casinos Worldwide</h1>
                <p>If there is one thing, we can say without a shadow of a doubt at CasinoWow it is that our experienced team of casino players and reviewers have an abiding passion for the industry, and the desire to use that passion to help our patrons find the best online casino for them. <br />

This is why we have created our very special Top 5 Online Casinos list, and we hope that it will help you become a better player! <br />

The brands who make the grade for this list are truly the best of the best in our estimation. They would have undergone a stringent vetting process where we delve into their business history, their financial standing, their brand reputation and more. <br />

We even consider the easily overlooked things like website security measures and how many contact methods they offer in terms of providing customer care. <br />

Overall our review process consists of a lot of hours testing and playing at various online casinos and comparing them with a check list and also taking into account players' feedback. <br />

We're a big community of casino reviewers at CasinoWow which means that you'll find many regulated online gambling markets and casinos on our site.</p>
