                <h1>Licence, Reputation and Trust</h1>
                <p>The first thing you need to look at is the site's reputation in the industry and among players. This can be hard if a platform is newly launched as it hasn't had time to build up a reputation yet. But with established sites, you will quickly be able to find casino reviews and player feedback. <br />

It's important to take this step and do your research to see what other players have to say before choosing to become a member of the platform. Players will often give feedback based on personal experience in terms of payout speed, customer service and the site's overall usability. <br />

When considering a crypto casino, another crucial aspect is the licensing information. A reliable and commonly accepted license, such as the one from Curacao, adds a layer of security to your online gaming experience. Be wary of platforms without clear licensing information, as they may pose a higher risk to your funds and gaming experience. Always prioritise platforms with reputable licenses to enhance the safety and reliability of your crypto casino endeavours. <br /></p>

                <h1>Provably Fair</h1>
                <p>The top crypto casinos will take great care in creating a secure gaming environment. Bitcoin sites, as well as other crypto casinos, will keep their games provably fair by using an algorithm that generates the hands and game outcomes and keeps them in a hash. This allows you to verify them at any time, should you wish. Thanks to the provably fair algorithm and the use of blockchain technology, there is also no need to involve any third parties. <br />

Any activity is directly between the player and the casino, with all game results publicly available at all times. <br />

If you compare a provably fair casino to a regular casino, you will see that a standard casino uses a random numbers generator, whereas a provably fair casino uses a provably fair algorithm. <br />

Traditional casinos don't allow player involvement in verifying whether the outcome of a game is correct and make use of third parties, which may or may not be trustworthy. Provably fair casinos allow you to check the results of the games independently and don't utilise the assistance of third parties.</p>

                <h1>Payout Terms</h1>
                <p>An important thing to look for is the payout speed and terms of the site you are thinking of joining. One of the benefits of crypto sites is fast, secure payouts. <br />

The majority of top sites offer secure payouts that are processed almost instantly and paid out within a couple of minutes.  <br />

Be sure to check the terms for any possible restrictions on withdrawals, such as minimum and maximum withdrawal limits. Some sites have high minimum withdrawal limits and no maximum withdrawal limits. Ideally, you want low withdrawal limits and preferably no limits on your withdrawals. If there are withdrawal limits, you want it to be as high as possible. <br />

One of the biggest advantages of the best crypto casinos listed on this page is the No Max Cash Out rule, so you don’t have to worry if you hit a big jackpot or if you’re a high roller. All your winnings can be withdrawn in the cryptocurrency of your choice in one single transaction.

                <h1>Game Range</h1>
                <p>Always visit the game library of crypto games and check out what the site has to offer. Not every site has the same range of games or the same variety. <br />

Many of the best brands are powered by SoftSwiss, which gives them access to thousands of games from the top software providers, such as Pragmatic Play, Hacksaw Gaming, Evolution and many more. Some operators have their own in-house and exclusive crypto games like Crash Games, Plinko and others. <br />

You may note that some Vegas providers like IGT, Novomatic, Aristocrat, and WMS are still lacking from the lineup, which may be due to legal issues. Another thing you'll find is that with some games, the credits will show in crypto, while others will convert the amount to USD, EUR or other fiat currencies. This may vary based on the game provider and the site operator. <br />

Some games will have low betting limits, while others come with high betting limits, allowing you to place big bets, which is ideal for high rollers.</p>

                <h1>VPN Play</h1>
                <p>A great thing about crypto casinos is that even if there are regional restrictions, you will be able to use a VPN. One of the biggest benefits of using a VPN is that it not only adds an extra layer of security to your crypto casino gaming experience but often enables you to get access to a wider range of games. <br />

Often, you'll find that some of the software providers used at your chosen casino are not accessible everywhere, which means they might not appear in the game library. With the use of a VPN, these games are 'unlocked' and available to you. <br />

Keep in mind that VPNs should not be used to hide your country if it violates the casino terms. This is a direct violation of casino terms and could result in your account being closed down. <br /></p>

                <h1>Bonuses & VIP Rewards</h1>
                <p>As a player at a crypto casino, you want to be able to enjoy the best games with the boost of frequent crypto bonuses. While regular bonuses are great, the latest VIP programs for crypto players are pushing the boundaries. They offer rakeback bonuses and cashbacks, which are attracting even more players. <br />

A big perk with crypto sites is that they tend to offer more bonuses and rewards than you'll find in fiat sites; these offers will often be bigger, too. While many crypto sites refrain from offering welcome bonuses, they will have great rewards programs with tier levels, where you can increase your bonuses with each new level you reach. <br />
