                  <h1>Old vs. New Slots</h1>
                  <p>
                  Land-based slot machines are vending cabinets found on casino floors all over the world and were the first form of slot games available to the public. The game revolves around multiple reels on a screen that spin to land various combinations. If you are lucky enough to land matching combinations of usually 3 or more icons over a demarcated payline, you will win back a cash prize in accordance with the wager you placed. It is usually a multiple of the wager placed per line.

The first slots machine’s reel rolls were triggered and rolled manually by analogue gearing systems. The ‘one arm bandit’ machines are a classic example of traditional slots, where a player would trigger the reel spin by pulling a lever on the side of the machine.

                  Already having surpassed the popularity of standard online casino slot gaming, is the mobile casino game technology. Modern advancements in technology allow for convenient ‘on the go’ gambling fun where ever you might find yourself whether you are waiting in a cue or taking a flutter on your lunch break. <br />

As long as you have a steady web connection, you can play a multitude of online slot games from your favourite device - mobile phone or tablet/iPad.

                  Nowadays, most online slot games can be played directly from your internet browser. All you will need to play on your desktop or laptop is a secure internet connection. There is no need for Adobe Flash Player to be installed on your device. Adobe blocked Flash content since January 2021. 

If you want to play from your mobile device browser, most modern slots are created for in-browser play through advanced HTML5 technology, which makes gaming integration simple, accommodating seamless play from all modern touch phones, including those operating via Android and iOS operating systems.

Slot games have one of the highest house edges of all casino games, which means that you need to approach playing them for the fun of it and realise that you are on the backfoot the moment you take the first roll of the reels.

However, the fairness of such games is guaranteed by the use of Random Number Generators (RNG), which make sure that the games payout at random and are in no way rigged.

                  <p>
                  The style of the machine and the themes offered differ dramatically. If you think this provides enough choice, think again, as there are many other things that set slots apart from each other: <br />

Paylines – the number of paylines differs from slot to slot. Classic machines can offer as little as 1 payline, and modern slots can offer 10, 15, 20, 25, 50, 100, 243, or even 1024 different pay ways. The more lines there are, the more chance of winning, but it could also result in a more expensive round, as you often pay per line. <br />

Volatility/Variance – Games can come with either low, medium or high variance, which is an indicator of how volatile a slot is. Low volatility means that wins remain quite constant, with smaller prizes. High volatility means there are long swings between wins. Here, you may wait longer for a string of wins, but when they come, they usually pay well.
